"Severity","Error","Description"
"Major","Legend","There is a legend that could have been turned into direct labeling. Direct labeling (i.e., placing labels close to the data points) instead of using a separate legend reduces the need for eye movements between the legend and the chart elements, thus it leads to faster and more accurate interpretation [@ratwani2008]."
"Minor","LegendBorder","The legend has a border (preventing free eye scan)"
"Minor","LegendInside","The legeng is inside the graph area"
"Major","RotatedXLabels","The labels on the X axis are rotated (not horizontal). Rotated labels can interfere with the viewer's ability to quickly interpret the data, as they require additional time for visual decoding; such effect is particularly pronounced in bar charts with long category labels [@Few2012]."
"Critical","NonZeroBased","A bar diagram with truncated bars, axis not starting at 0. This is a serious problem concerning the visual integrity of the diagram, in particualar it affects proportionality [@tufte1983], thus falsifying the quantitative message of the diagram."
"Minor","WasteSpace","A large portion of graph area is empty. This is a bad us of space that dilutes the visual message in the graph."
"Minor","HeavyGrid","The grid of the graph is heavy. If the visual presence of grid is so strong to almost obscure the data, the visual message is lost [@tufte1983]."
"Minor","HeavyBackground","The background is heavy.  If the background is so intense to almost obscure the data or to draw attention away from the data, the visual message is lost [@tufte1983]."
"Critical","SimilarColors","Graph uses very similar colors, hard to tell apart. Research indicates that low contrast between colors (especially in terms of luminosity) can reduce the speed and accuracy of information interpretation [@ware2013, @silva2011]."
"Minor","PatternFill","Area fill is using a parttern (e.g., lines or dots) instead of diferent hues or gray levels. Excessive use of patterns can create a 'busy' appearance, making it harder for viewers to focus on the main data trends [@Few2012]."
"Minor","Raster","Usage of low resolution raster images instead of vectorial format. When a figure uses a raster image with poor resolution it appears unpleasantly grainy -- espectially when zoomed in -- and possibly difficult to read."
"Major","GridDistinctRanges","When multiple graph are present (grid of chars, a.k.a. small multiples), the corresponding axes have different intervals. @heer2009 shows that when the scales are consistent across all plots, viewers can quickly and accurately compare values; while inconsistent axes may lead to misinterpretation."
"Major","Overplotting","There are too many overplotted points that prevent distinguishing individual points. It leads to misleading interpretations, particularly in scatter plots used to show relationships or correlations; since the points are not distinguishable, viewers may fail to detect underlying relationships or trends [@Few2012]."
"Critical","DoubleScale","The graph uses a double (vertical) scale. Research in cognitive science [@Few2012] suggests that people may misinterpret trends if they do not notice the differing scales, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about the correlation between the two datasets."
"Major","Unlabeled","The axes are not labeled. While the meaning of the axes can be inferred from the caption of the main text of the article, the lack of labels makes understanding the graph much less immediate."
"Critical","Deformed","The graph is somehow deformed with proportion not consistente across the area. Often this is -- wrongly -- used to emphasize some detail instead of using more suitable techniques, the reuslt is a deception of the observer [@pandey2015]."
"Major","3D","There are 3D effects. The additional cognitive effort required for 3D interpretation often results in slower reaction times and higher error rates [@ware2013]."
"Critical","MissingAxesRef","The whole axes or the tick marks are missing. This make the quantitative information contained in the diagram fuzzy and imprecise failing the goal of conveying accurate information."
"Major","Mislabeled","Labels are obscuring or get confused with data. A key recommendation when creating a diagram is 'above all show the data' [@tufte1983]."
"Minor","TooMuchPrecision","The graph reports values that have a too high precision (decimal digits) for the intended purpose. Any additional information that is not necessary increases the cognitive load and makes the graph less understandable [@Few2012]."
"Minor","Shadow","The graph makes use of shadows. Using shadows as well as other decorative visual effects reduces the data-to-ink ratio and makes the diagram cluttered, thus weakening the visual message [@tufte1983]."
"Critical","Cropped","The graph is cropped and some details are not visible since they lay outside. This impedes the vision of part of the diagram."
"Major","InterruptedScale","One of the axes is interrupted and restarted after a discontinuity to show extremely spread values. Axis breaks can affect the perceived effect size, leading viewers to believe that the differences between data points are more significant than they actually are [@pandey2015]."
"Major","SilentLog","One of the axes uses a log scale but this is not clearly mentioned. While log scales help in visualizing both small and large values in the same plot without extreme compression or skewing of the data points [@cleveland1994], viewers often misinterpret log scales if the axis labels do not clearly indicate the logarithmic nature of the scale [@Few2012]."
"Critical","TooManyCats","The graph encodes too many categories (usually more than six) with attributes like color or shape. For instance, @macdonald1999 recommends that the number of colors used to represent nominal data should be restricted to seven or less, while sudies by @ware2013 found that people can typically distinguish 4 to 6 distinct shapes effectively."
"Minor","OverlappedLabels","Labels are overlapping with each other. Overlapping labels are difficult to read thus they require additional effort or make impossible understanding."
"Minor","ColorsUncoded","There are many color not corresponding to an explicit coding (legend or other). If colors are used purely for decorative purposes without encoding information, they may inadvertently create a false visual hierarchy, drawing attention away from the key data elements [@Few2012]."
"Minor","WrappedXLabs","Labels on the x axis are wrapped due to limited space. Wrapped labels are more difficult to read, often they can be solved with a simple graph redesign."
